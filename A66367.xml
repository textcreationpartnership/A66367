            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Whereby, all men may ſee how the <hi>Church,</hi> and poor Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> do ſeem to ſtand in the hands of <hi>Scyron</hi> and <hi>Procruſtes:</hi> The Souldiers of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> that fought againſt their King, and do ſtill detain the Church-land from the Biſhop; And now (like that in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> wounded in the houſe of our friends.) the Souldiers in 49. that were <hi>moſt faithful</hi> unto your Majeſty, do ſtill ſeek to take away <hi>our Houſes</hi> from the Church. And if we loſe both <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> we may go to live in the <hi>Church,</hi> and lie with the <hi>Levite</hi> in the Streets.</p>
                  <p>But, as your Majeſty hath been <hi>moſt Gracious</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:38242:4"/> Biſhops, and to <hi>all</hi> the Clergy ſo <hi>bountifull,</hi> as to grant them <hi>almoſt</hi> as much as we could deſire; ſo our hope and <hi>humble Requeſt</hi> is, that you will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>theſe men</hi> to take from us, <hi>ſo much</hi> as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                  <p>For the preventing of which deſire of theirs, if it may be; I have endeavoured to arm my ſelf with a <hi>reſolution,</hi> neither to <hi>fear</hi> nor <hi>flatter</hi> any man; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And I doubt not, but that this <hi>my Diſcourſe</hi> will prove as the waters of gall, and as bitter as <hi>wormwood</hi> unto thoſe mens ſtomacks, that are ſo <hi>greedy,</hi> as we ſee men are, to get away the <hi>lands</hi> and poſſeſſions of the Church, and my ſelf to be <hi>maligned</hi> and envyed to the full; But I aſſure them, <hi>Non flocci facio,</hi> I weigh it not a ruſh; for I have hardened my face <hi>like an Adamant,</hi> and as the Lord ſaith to <hi>Ezechiel, Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</hi> I will ſpeak what I conceive

And if in <hi>any thing</hi> I ſhall miſtake, it is not <hi>amor erroris,</hi> the love of error, or the hatred of any of thoſe <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> perſons that rob the Church; but it is <hi>error amoris,</hi> the error of my love to the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and unfaigned deſire, to promote the <hi>ſervice of God,</hi> and the good of the <hi>poor and honeſt Iriſh</hi> of this Kingdom; and ſo if I have <hi>offended,</hi> I ſhall <hi>humbly</hi> crave your Majeſties <hi>pardon,</hi> and moſt <hi>willingly</hi> ſubmit my ſelf to the cenſure of the <hi>Church;</hi> and with my <hi>morning, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and <hi>noon-daies</hi> prayers for your Majeſtie's <hi>long-life,</hi> and much happineſs, I reſt.</p>

                  <p>Therefore I have undertaken, in the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of my Conſcience, and according to the beſt and <hi>uttermoſt</hi> of my knowledge, without the <hi>leaſt ill thought</hi> of any of you all, or the leaſt covetous deſire, to take <hi>any thing</hi> from you, that is <hi>inoffenſively</hi> your due: but to diſcharge the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

And what you <hi>imagin</hi> I do herein <hi>againſt</hi> you, I do aſſure you, if you will believe me, it is not ſo much to get either <hi>lands</hi> or <hi>hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> from you, as to <hi>hinder</hi> you, as I conceive, ſo <hi>deeply</hi> to wound your own ſelves: For, Better is a <hi>little</hi> that is duly gotten, without blame, and brings a <hi>bleſſing</hi> with it; than a <hi>great deal,</hi> that is unjuſtly obtained, with a <hi>curſe</hi> at the heels of it. But you will ſay, That you do nothing but what you <hi>juſtly</hi> may do by the Laws of our Land, and what <hi>others</hi> do, and have done before you. And truly I do think ſo too: But I have <hi>fully</hi> anſwered this Allegation, and, as I ſuppoſe, <hi>whatſoever elſe</hi> can be ſaid, in this Treatiſe; And <hi>I</hi> ask of you, Whether you <hi>conceive,</hi> that Humane Laws, and <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> made by <hi>powerful</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and either through <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>errour;</hi> can make that which is againſt the <hi>Will,</hi> and contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, to be no ſin? or <hi>free</hi> the ſinner from God's <hi>wrath?</hi> Or, do you think, that <hi>I</hi> ſtand againſt ſo <hi>many</hi> well-deſerving Gentlemen, of ſuch <hi>means</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> as you are, only for <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> to gain the Rent of a <hi>few</hi> hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and no longer, than the remainder of a poor <hi>old man's life?</hi> Surely, not any one, that had but the leaſt <hi>inch</hi> of worldly wiſdom, would do ſo: For, beſides my <hi>pains</hi> and labour, <hi>I</hi> have ſpent <hi>already,</hi> and ſhall ſpend <hi>yet,</hi> before the Church ſhall <hi>loſe</hi> them, perhaps <hi>ten times</hi> more than my <hi>ſpan-long life</hi> ſhall gain by them: And what of that? <hi>I</hi> have done my <hi>beſt,</hi> when <hi>I</hi> have <hi>loſt</hi> them, <hi>Et liberavi animam meam,</hi> and ſhall leave to God <hi>Cauſam ſuam,</hi> Let

                           <p>TRuſty and welbeloved, We greet you well. We have lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the State of our Cathedral and Collegiat Churches into our Princely Conſideration, that We may be the better able to preſerve that livelyhood, which as yet is left unto them. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this deliberation We find, that of later times, there hath not riſen a greater inconvenience, then by turning Leaſes of one and twenty years into Lives; for by that means, the preſent Dean and Chapter put great Fines into their Purſes, to enrich themſelves, their wives and children, and leave their Succeſſors, of what deſerts ſoever, to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and the Church, deſtitute of that growing means, which elſe would come in to help them. By which courſe, ſhould it continue, ſcarce any of them could be able to live and keep houſe, according to their Place and Callings. We know the Statute makes it alike lawful for a Dean and Chapter to let their Leaſes for the Term of one and twenty years, or three Lives; but time and experience have made it apparent, that there is a great deal of difference between them, eſpecially in Church-Leaſes, where men are commonly in years before they come to thoſe Places. Theſe are therefore to will and command you, upon peril of Our utmoſt diſpleaſure, and what ſhall follow thereon, that notwithſtanding any Statute, or any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever, you preſume not to let and Leaſe belonging to your Church into Lives, that is not in Lives already. And further, where any fair opportunity is offered you, if any ſuch be, you fail not to reduce ſuch as are in Lives into Years. And We do likewiſe will and require, that theſe our Letters may remain upon Record in your own Regiſter-Books, and in the Regiſter of the Lord Biſhop of that Dioces, that he may take notice of theſe our Commands unto you, and give <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and our Royal Succeſſors knowledge, if you preſume in any ſort to diſobey them.<note place="margin">O that the mind and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this moſt <hi>godly King,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this Letter, had bin obſerved by all our <hi>Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> Biſhops, Deanes, and Chapters; the which I will do, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerve it, by the grace of God.</note> And further, whereas in Our late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, We have commanded all our Biſhops reſpectively, not to lett any Leaſe, after We have named any of them to a better Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, but did not in thoſe Inſtructions name the Deans, who yet were intended by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s: Theſe are therefore to declare unto you, that no Dean ſhall preſume to renew any Leaſe, either into Lives or Years, after ſuch time as We have nominated him either to a better Dena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or a Biſhoprick, having obſerved, that at ſuch times of remove, many men care not what, or how they lett, to the prejudice of the Church and their Succeſſors. And this is Our expreſſe Command to you, your Chapter, and your Succeſſors, which in any caſe We require both you, and them, ſtrictly to obſerve, upon pain of Our high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and as you and they will anſwer the contrary at your and their utmoſt perils.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>YOu have heard, how that God hath given the <hi>Power</hi> and Authority unto <hi>Kings</hi> and Princes, to be the <hi>Superviſors,</hi> Directors, and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of things amiſs, as well in the <hi>Church,</hi> as in the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> And how he requireth and <hi>commandeth</hi> them, to diſcharge <hi>thoſe Duties</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and to have a care to <hi>preſerve</hi> his Religion, as they do regard their own <hi>Salvation.</hi> You have likewiſe heard, how all Kings, both <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did execute that <hi>power,</hi> and, according to their ability, diſcharged their <hi>Duties,</hi> as well in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> juriſdiction of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> cauſes, as in the deciſion of <hi>Civil</hi> cauſes. It reſteth, that I ſhould ſhew unto you, the <hi>chiefeſt Parts</hi> and Duties, that they <hi>owe</hi> to God, and are to <hi>diſcharge,</hi> for the promoting of his <hi>Service,</hi> and the Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And I conceive them <hi>principally</hi> to conſiſt in theſe Four <hi>Points,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The four chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things that Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to do for the uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God's Religion, and the Service of Jeſus Chriſt.</note> which may be like the four Rivers of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> to water the <hi>Garden</hi> of God's Church, to make it to bring forth <hi>plenty</hi> of fruits, to the <hi>glory</hi> of God, and the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of mens ſouls.

                        <p>That the payment of Tythes unto the Church, is not a caſe of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome but of Conſcience; When as the tenth by a Divine right is the Teacher's tribute, and the very firſt part of the wages that God appointed to be paid unto his Work men; and therefore, that it is as haynous a ſin, and as foul an offence, to defraud the Miniſter of this due; as it is to detain the meat, or money, of the Labouring-man, which is one of the four crying ſins.</p>

                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plinius.</hi> l. 12. c. 14.</note> That the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> worſhipped a god, whom they ſirnamed <hi>Sabis,</hi> and that they uſed to pay the <hi>Tythes</hi> of all their goods unto that <hi>imaginary</hi> god.</p>
                     <p>And what is the cauſe, that theſe <hi>Heathens,</hi> which knew not the <hi>True God,</hi> did theſe things? but that the light of <hi>reaſon,</hi> which the God of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> imprinted in their minds, <hi>informed</hi> them, that the <hi>tenth part</hi> of their <hi>fruits</hi> and increaſe, ſhould appertain to the proviſion of thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> that ſerved their god: And the reaſon,<note place="margin">Why the 10th is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per number that belongeth to God.</note> why they conceived the <hi>tenth part</hi> to be more properly due to their gods, rather than the <hi>eighth, ninth, eleventh, twelfth,</hi> or <hi>thirteenth,</hi> or any other number more or leſs, was becauſe the <hi>tenth number</hi> is the <hi>perfecteſt,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt</hi> number that is, beyond which, there is no <hi>other</hi> number, but by the <hi>addition</hi> and re-iteration of the <hi>ſame</hi> former numbers thereunto, which you may obſerve in <hi>all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;</hi> and in the <hi>Arithmetical</hi> explanation thereof, you have <hi>no figures,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> well obſerveth, that reach any further than 9. to which you add the <hi>cypher</hi> 0 to make up 10. and that <hi>cypher</hi> 0, being <hi>circular</hi> and round, is the <hi>Hieroglyphic</hi> expreſſing the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> which, like unto this <hi>cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> 0, hath neither <hi>beginning</hi> nor <hi>ending,</hi> and doth therefore challenge this <hi>number,</hi> that is <hi>like</hi> himſelf, unto <hi>himſelf.</hi> And the <hi>higheſt reach</hi> of mans <hi>natural</hi> reaſon, could not any <hi>better</hi> way acknowledge the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> of the God of <hi>Nature,</hi> than by aſſigning <hi>that quantity</hi> of their goods which they offered to him, by this <hi>number</hi> 10. which is the higheſt, and the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> number that is, and containeth <hi>all other numbers</hi> within it; when as after 9. you have no more <hi>figures,</hi> but adding this <hi>cypher</hi> 0. And the re-iteration of the <hi>ſame figures</hi> from 1. to 9. with the <hi>cyphers</hi> unto them, it makes up <hi>all numbers</hi> from 10. to 10. thouſand thouſands.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this payment of the <hi>Tythes</hi> unto the Prieſts, being a truth which <hi>Nature</hi> teacheth, and which I believe was the proportion of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and oblation that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought to God, it muſt needs be the truth of God, that the Tythes are due unto the Prieſts by a Natural and Divine Right, and ſo never to be altered nor repealed.</p>

                        <p>The Anſwer to the choiceſt, and chiefeſt Objection that the Schoole of Anabaptiſts have made, and do urge againſt the payment of Tythes now, in the time of the Goſpel.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt, though the <hi>truth</hi> of this point, that all <hi>Tythes,</hi> as well in the time of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as under the <hi>Law,</hi> and before the law, are <hi>continually</hi> due to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>eternal Prieſt;</hi> and ſo at all times <hi>payable,</hi> and to be given to his <hi>Subſtitutes</hi> and under-Prieſts, is as <hi>clear</hi> as the <hi>Sun:</hi> yet, ſuch hath been and is the <hi>malice</hi> of Satan againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> that he hath raiſed up, and <hi>ſtirred</hi> a whole <hi>Army</hi> of Sectaries, Anabaptiſts, and Worldlings, that with might and main do <hi>fight</hi> againſt this <hi>Truth,</hi> and labour with all their <hi>wits,</hi> to ſuppreſs the ſame, and to drive it quite out of the <hi>World:</hi> And to that end, they do Object.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If all <hi>Tythes</hi> be thus due, as you ſay, by the <hi>Law of God,</hi>

                     <p>But many <hi>Countreys,</hi> and ſome Chriſtian <hi>Common-wealthes,</hi> no doubt, pay no <hi>Tythes</hi> at all, and are not acquainted with this <hi>faſhion</hi> of paying <hi>Tythes,</hi> and yet do ſufficiently and <hi>honorably</hi> maintain their <hi>Miniſters</hi> for the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, queſtionleſs, the payment of <hi>Tythes</hi> is not due by the Divine Law.</p>

                     <p>But ſeeing that in the Apoſtles <hi>time,</hi> the good Chriſtians ſold their <hi>lands</hi> and poſſeſſions, and laid down the <hi>prices</hi> and monies, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for them, at the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> feet; I demand, Why do not our <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> that would have all things reduced to the <hi>Primitive</hi> time, imitate them in <hi>this their Devotion,</hi> and lay the prices of their <hi>lands</hi> at their <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> feet?

                     <p>So we ſay, That in <hi>thoſe Churches,</hi> which pay not their <hi>Tythes</hi> in kind, there is an <hi>allowance,</hi> equivalent to the <hi>Tythes,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And though <hi>all this</hi> that I have ſaid be <hi>very true;</hi> yet, becauſe, as I conceive, it taketh not away the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the foreſaid Argument, which is, That if it be a <hi>Moral Precept,</hi> that doth <hi>oblige</hi> us to obſerve it, <hi>ſemper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> then it obligeth <hi>all men,</hi> and in <hi>all places,</hi> to pay their <hi>Tythes,</hi> and they <hi>ſin,</hi> that pay them not, though they do pay ſome <hi>other ſtipend,</hi> be it more or leſs in lieu of them; becauſe it lieth not in man to <hi>alter</hi> or <hi>change</hi> the Commandment of God, but to do what he commandeth them; Therefore,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſay, and yield,<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>And if man, by his <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> hath obſcured this <hi>light</hi> of nature, and obliterated that <hi>impreſſion,</hi> which God had imprinted in his heart, and through his own <hi>negligence</hi> or forgetfulneſs remembreth neither <hi>the day</hi> that he ſhould keep <hi>holy,</hi> nor that <hi>part</hi> that he ſhould <hi>pay</hi> for his Service: Shall that make the <hi>Commandment</hi> of God of <hi>none effect,</hi> or acquit man, for the <hi>not performance</hi> of his duty?

                     </argument>
                     <p>YOu have heard of the <hi>firſt part</hi> of the Miniſters maintenance; the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part</hi> conſiſteth in the <hi>voluntary Oblations,</hi> or <hi>Free-wil-offerings</hi> of the people, which the Lord requireth ſhould be done, according as every one, in his <hi>own heart,</hi> thought good, to beſtow upon the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God: and what <hi>they did</hi> offer in this kind was moſt acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>For this is a <hi>Principal Branch</hi> of that Honor, which we <hi>yield</hi> unto God, by and with our ſubſtance, which we are injoyned to do, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38242:61"/> which, as <hi>neceſſity</hi> exacts it, ſo it is <hi>ſoon</hi> paſſed, and as <hi>quickly</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth; but <hi>thoſe Donations,</hi> that were given for the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, as they ſavour of a <hi>more inward</hi> and deeper piety, ſo they are of a more <hi>laſting</hi> ſubſtance; and, beſides the <hi>eternal Treaſures,</hi> which men do <hi>thereby</hi> lay up for themſelves, they do provide for the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of Religion, unto the <hi>after-ages</hi> of men, and may be juſtly ſaid to <hi>Honour God,</hi> not only in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but in <hi>all thoſe</hi> likewiſe, which they gain, by their <hi>Donations,</hi> to <hi>Honor</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſtrange, and marvellous, to conſider how liberal, and how free the people of old time, were in their <hi>Donations</hi> and <hi>Free-wil-offerings,</hi> to maintain the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, and to do any thing, that did any wayes appertain to his <hi>ſervice;</hi> for if you look into the 36. <hi>Chapt.</hi> of <hi>Exod.</hi> verſ. 5. you ſhall find how <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bring much more then enough, for the ſervice of the work,</hi> which the Lord <hi>hath commanded</hi> to be made;<note place="margin">Exod. 36.5, 6, 7.</note> and <hi>Moſes</hi> gave commandment, and cauſed it to be <hi>Proclaimed</hi> through the Camp, that <hi>they ſhould bring no more,</hi> for that they had <hi>already</hi> brought enough and <hi>too much:</hi> So they that returned out of <hi>Babylon</hi> were as <hi>ready</hi> and as <hi>willing,</hi> to offer up their gifts and <hi>free-wil-offerings</hi> for the ſervice of the <hi>Temple,</hi> as their <hi>Forefathers</hi> were, for the erecting of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi>

                     <p>And therefore, if you would abandon <hi>Popery,</hi> and ſuppreſs all <hi>popiſh Prieſts</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is my heart's deſire; then I deſire <hi>withal,</hi> that this, and all other lewd and wicked <hi>cuſtomes</hi> be taken away; the <hi>lands,</hi> hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and poſſeſſions of the Church be <hi>reſtored;</hi> and all <hi>impropriations</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their <hi>firſt inſtitution,</hi> that ſo a <hi>ſufficient Miniſtery</hi> may be maintained here in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they are in <hi>England;</hi> and that the poor <hi>ignorant Iriſh</hi> may have honeſt and able <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters,<note place="margin">And to that end the natives, according to the inſtitution of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhould be placed in the Colledge at <hi>Dublin;</hi> the which thing hitherto, they ſay, hath been too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</note> and, as many as may be, of their own <hi>Nation,</hi> to live <hi>amongſt them,</hi> and to <hi>inſtruct them:</hi> and then God will <hi>bleſſe</hi> this Nation, and the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion will proſper and <hi>flouriſh,</hi> and both we and they ſhall live <hi>happily</hi> together; which <hi>otherwiſe</hi> will very <hi>hardly,</hi> if ever, come to paſs: Becauſe that <hi>now,</hi> we have not our knowledge by <hi>inſpiration,</hi> we cannot in an inſtant, underſtand and ſpeak <hi>all Tongues,</hi> and we cannot work <hi>miracles;</hi> but we muſt buy many Books to learn <hi>Languages,</hi> and to get <hi>knowledge,</hi> which the Apoſtles had without <hi>any Book;</hi> and we muſt ſpend our time, in reading, writing, ſtudying, and praying to God to aſſiſt us, and to inable us, to inſtruct our people: and all this cannot be done without <hi>maintenance</hi> and means to do it.

I ſay, that many <hi>wicked</hi> Kings, and <hi>cruel</hi> Emperours have ſet up <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and blaſphemy againſt God, and yet I do not find that any of Gods ſervants did ever <hi>rebell</hi> againſt them; for you know <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, did ſet up golden Calves to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> made an Image of gold, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his people to fall down to worſhip it.

                     <p>And the reaſon why they did all this,<note place="margin">The reaſon of their rebellion</note> and proceeded thus farre againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> is intimated in the words of my Text, <hi>Aemulati ſunt,</hi> becauſe they would <hi>emulate</hi> or <hi>imitate Moſes,</hi> that is, to play the <hi>Moſes,</hi> or play the <hi>King,</hi> and play the part of the <hi>chief</hi> Prieſt themſelves; for this is certain, that none will <hi>envy,</hi> murmure at, ſlander, and diſobey his King ſo farre, as to make an <hi>open</hi> rebellion againſt him, but they that in <hi>ſome</hi> ſort would rule and be Kings themſelves; eſpecially when they ſhall ſeek, ſo farre to <hi>debilitate</hi> their Prince, as that he ſhall be <hi>no</hi> wayes able to make reſiſtance; for they think, <hi>If Treaſon proſper, 'tis no Treaſon; what's the reaſon? if it proſper, who dares call it Treaſon?</hi> and none would diſobey their Biſhops or chief Prieſts, but they that would, and cannot be Biſhops themſelves; becauſe <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ambition</hi> are the two ſides of that bellowes, which blowes up diſobedience and rebellion.</p>
                     <p>But they that are bad <hi>ſervants,</hi> will prove worſe <hi>Maſters;</hi> they that will not learn how to <hi>obey</hi> can never tell how to <hi>rule;</hi> and if <hi>Moſes</hi> were, as theſe <hi>Rebels</hi> ſuggeſted, a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> yet the Philoſopher tells us, we had better endure <hi>one</hi> Tyrant, then, as they were, 250.

                     <p>And yet all this will not do this deed, until the King paſſeth His <hi>aſſent;</hi> for as yet the new Law of <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> without the King,<note place="margin">The Kings great pains to ſearch out the truth.</note> was not hatched; And the good King, having ſo <hi>graciouſly,</hi> ſo <hi>indefatigably</hi> taken ſuch care and ſuch pains, in his own Perſon every day, to hear and ſee all that could be <hi>laid</hi> unto his charge, and how he had <hi>anſwered</hi> each particular, was ſo juſt, and of ſuch tender and religious conſcience, that he was not ſatisfied (as men conceived) with the <hi>weight</hi> of thoſe reaſons that

The <hi>task</hi> was, to procure his <hi>aſſent</hi> to paſſe this Bill; and how ſhall this be done? As the <hi>Man of God</hi> could not be perſwaded by any man, but by <hi>a Man of God,</hi> a Prophet by a Prophet; ſo now the Biſhops that were <hi>good</hi> men, men of conſcience, and <hi>ſet apart</hi> by God to reſolve and ſatisfie weak and tender conſciences, are thought fit to be ſent unto this <hi>good</hi> King, to perſwade him, (as men ſuppoſed) that, to prevent a <hi>greater</hi> miſchief, he might <hi>juſtly</hi> paſſe this Bill; and either 6. or 4. of the <hi>prime</hi> Prelates, are requeſted by the Lords, to go unto the King, to <hi>aſſay</hi> how far they can <hi>prevail</hi> with him herein: And ſo they went; and how they dealt with His Majeſty, I do not <hi>fully</hi> underſtand, but am informed by ſome that went, that they aſſured Him, he ought to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> himſelf in point of <hi>Law</hi> by his Judges, and of <hi>State</hi> by his Council: And how they did any otherwiſe, in any other thing rectifie his Conſcience, in point of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which belonged unto themſelves, I cannot tell.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd thus the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of this Kingdom, and the Faction in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have by their craft and ſubtilty prevailed to have all the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> impediments of their Deſign to be removed: So now the <hi>hedge</hi> is broken down, and all the <hi>Boars</hi> of the Forreſt may <hi>now</hi> come into the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to deſtroy the <hi>vine,</hi> and to undermine the <hi>City</hi> of God: But, <hi>into their counſels let not my ſoul come.</hi>

And theſe I find to be principally five.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The gaining of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to become their faſt and faithful friends.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The framing of a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> to frighten the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and to inſnare the <hi>ſimple,</hi> to be led as they liſted to proſecute their Deſign.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The condemning of our <hi>late Canons,</hi> as abominable in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with their Religion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The appointing of a <hi>new Synod,</hi> the like whereof was never heard in the Church, ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> to compoſe ſuch <hi>Articles</hi> as they liked, and to frame ſuch <hi>Diſcipline</hi> as ſhould be moſt agreeable to their own diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſetling of a <hi>Militia,</hi> a word that the vulgar knew not what it was, for to <hi>ſecure</hi> the Kingdom, as they pretended, from thoſe dangers that they feared, that is, from thoſe <hi>Jacks</hi> of Lent, and men of <hi>Clouts,</hi> which themſelves ſet up as <hi>deadly</hi> enemies unto the Church and State; but indeed <hi>inſenſibly</hi> to get all the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Realm into their own hands, and their Confederates; that ſo they might, like the <hi>Ephori,</hi> bridle the King, and bring him as they pleaſed, to <hi>aboliſh,</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> what Laws and Government they ſhould propoſe; whereby, perhaps, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue King in <hi>Name,</hi> but they in <hi>Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe were the things they <hi>aimed</hi> at, and they effected the firſt three, before they could be <hi>diſcryed,</hi> and their Plots diſcovered; but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, they were prevented, when God ſaid unto them, as he doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further, here ſhalt thou ſtay thy proud waves:</hi> And therefore, I am confident (and I wiſh all good Chriſtians were ſo) that their purpoſes ſhall never ſucceed, nor themſelves <hi>proſper</hi> therein, while the World laſteth; becauſe God hath ſo mercifully <hi>revealed</hi> ſo much, ſo graciouſly <hi>aſſiſted</hi> our King, and ſo miraculouſly, not only <hi>delivered</hi> him from them, but alſo <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> him againſt them, contrary to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing likely-hood, to this very day; which is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> argument to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our faith, that we ſhall by the help of our God, eſcape all the <hi>reſt</hi> of their deſtructive Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>But to diſplay their <hi>Banners,</hi> to diſcover their <hi>Projects,</hi> and to let the <hi>World</hi> ſee what they are, and how <hi>cloſely</hi> and yet <hi>cunningly,</hi> they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to effect their work; I will in a <hi>plain</hi> manner ſet down what I know, and

                     <p>Or were theſe things but our <hi>jealouſies</hi> and fears, which do wear the <hi>garments</hi> of Truth; yet their <hi>proceedings</hi> in Parliament do add more fuell unto the fire of our ſuſpicion; as, for our men, whom we have choſen to <hi>plead</hi> for us, and to <hi>treat</hi> with them, to reſpect them more than us, to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> them, by impoveriſhing us,<note place="margin">How they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards the Scots.</note> giving them no leſſe than 300000. l. who had entered into our Land and brought upon us ſuch <hi>fears,</hi> of I know not how many miſchiefs that might ſucceed; and not only ſo, but alſo, (to ſhew what <hi>love</hi> they bare to them, and how <hi>little</hi> regard they had of us, their <hi>Native</hi> Brethren, that put ſuch truſt and confidence in their fidelity, as to commit all our fortunes and liberties into their hands) paying <hi>weekly</hi> ſuch a Penſion for their proviſion, (beſides the maintenance of our <hi>own</hi> Army, which were forced to carry them their monies, when themſelves were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid) as in a <hi>ſhort</hi> time was able to exhauſt <hi>all</hi> the wealth of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and yet for all his Majeſties <hi>continual</hi> calling upon them to <hi>diſpatch</hi> their diſcharge, and to <hi>finiſh</hi> the Treaty, for the good of <hi>both</hi> Kingdoms, keeping them here ſo exceeding <hi>long,</hi> and making ſo very <hi>much</hi> of them, (which in truth we envyed not, but admired what it meant, when we ſaw with what continual <hi>feaſtings</hi> they were entertained in <hi>London,</hi> and their <hi>lodgings</hi> frequented as the Kings Court) till all the people began to <hi>murmur,</hi> and to wax weary of ſo <hi>great</hi> a charge, and ſuch a burden, as they knew muſt at laſt light upon their ſhoulders; which muſt needs be matters worthy of our beſt examinations.</p>

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:38242:113"/> all men underſtood, to do ſomewhat which the <hi>ignorant</hi> did not underſtand, then ſuch a <hi>voluntary</hi> Proteſtation might do the deed; for they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to maintain the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of Parliament.

                  <p>Which are eaſily ſeen and perceived in every ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>And ſo all the greedy worldlings, and the covetous hunters after wealth are invironed with theſe three main indigences and wants; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They have no light in their underſtanding, but their heads and brains are empty, when their barns and their ſhops and coffers are full; and ſo at laſt, they themſelves do moſt wofully confeſs it, ſaying, <hi>We have erred from the way of truth, and the light of underſtanding hath not ſhined into us;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sap. 5.6.</note> for if men had but the leaſt underſtanding in the truth of things, they might ſoon perceive, that riches are neither ſimply ours, nor very precious, or of much value in themſelves; but they do, as <hi>Boetius</hi> ſaith, make a fairer ſhew, and bring more benefit unto us,<note place="margin">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38242:212"/> and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, this is a ſore evil which he ſaw under the Sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;<note place="margin">Eccl. 5.13.</note> when it had been better for them to have been without them than to have them. For as the rich Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> that never offended the Commonwealth, nor medled with either of the two oppoſite factions of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> yet being deſirous to know who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the Enemies of the State, and running to ſee their names, he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the firſt, and then he cries out, wo is me, that my wealth and my fair houſe at <hi>Nola</hi> do cauſe me to loſe my head: ſo the riches of many a man have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got him enemies, and thoſe enemies, for none other cauſe or crime, but to get his Lands or his wealth, have brought him to his end; as perhaps the riches of many a Proteſtant will conclude them to be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; as we read the like in the caſe of the <hi>Guelphes</hi> and the <hi>Gibilines,</hi> when the <hi>Gibilines</hi> proving themſelves to be no <hi>Guelphes,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet as the hoording up of riches, and the growing great and wealthy in the world makes us miſerable and hated, ſo the diſperſing of them abroad, and the profuſe waſting of our wealth, makes us poor, and to be deſpiſed, yea and to be neglected of our friends, and ſcorned of our enemies.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſurely riches are but very poor things, when we can neither poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them without envy, nor beſtow them without penury, neither have them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, nor want them without contempt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The wealth and riches of the worldlings can yield them but cold comfort, when God turneth away his face from them, and they are left to the counſels of their own hearts; for though the glittering of the Jewels may draw thine eyes after them, the pleaſant proſpect of the Fields may delight thine heart, thy gay apparel may make thee ſhew very fair and beautiful to the beholders, and the multitude of thy ſervants may ſeem to prove thee very happy among thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; yet we all do or may know, that there is none of theſe things but at ſome time or other hath proved to be the deſtruction of their poſſeſſors: For, as when the poor Paſſenger may rejoyce and ſing before the moſt ravenous Robber, and in the ſight of the moſt barbarous Plunderers, ſo thy wealth and thy Jewels, thy pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets full of Gold, and thy back full of bravery, may make thy heart ſad, and thy head full of perturbations, and in every moment to be afraid to be aſſailed and ſlain in all the paths that thou ſhalt walk.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the man that hath none but himſelf to ſerve himſelf, need not fear to be betrayed by his Servants: the rich man that needeth more, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man that keepeth many Servants, may well fear there may be a <hi>Judas</hi> among twelve, and a Traytor in his own houſe; and as <hi>Humphrey Baniſter</hi> betrayed his Lord and Maſter, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that had been too good a Maſter to him;<note place="margin">

                  <p>And therefore Wealth and Riches can afford us no true comfort, nor yield us any certain aſſiſtance, even in this life; when by getting them, we do oftentimes loſe our ſelves, or at leaſt hazard our ſafety by ſaving them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> or with the word of his power, that is, Jeſus Chriſt; Yet,</p>

                  <p>And becauſe all of us were then in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>Levi</hi> was in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> when he met with <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> therefore his calamity was not perſonal, but ſpecifical; and his iniquity brought a vanity upon us all, which is the vanity of our condition; ſo that now every man is nothing elſe but vanity, the Saint as well as the ſinner, the rich as well as the poor, and the Noble man as well as the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; for as ſoon as the nobleſt of men is inobled with the name of a man, ſo ſoon doth he inherit the title of a vain man, or a man of vanity, that is repleniſhed with all vanity, becauſe filled with all unrighteouſneſs. But</p>
